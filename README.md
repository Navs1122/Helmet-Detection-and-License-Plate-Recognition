## 📌 Abstract

This project proposes an automated solution for enhancing road safety through:
- **Helmet Detection** using YOLOv5
- **License Plate Recognition** using CNN + OCR (Tesseract)
- **Automatic Challan Generation** for traffic violators

The system detects motorbike riders, checks for helmet compliance, extracts license plate numbers, and notifies registered vehicle owners.
